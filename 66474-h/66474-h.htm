<p>
Now I see the secret of the making of the best
persons.
</p>

<p>
It is to grow in the open air, and to eat and
sleep with the earth.—<em>Whitman.</em>

<hr class="tb" />

<p class="noindent">
I will describe it to you. Perhaps you can find a new name for it.
</p>

<p>
It is a place where men do not hold up their heads and look free.
</p>

<p>
Where men dare not seek what they were born for: life.
</p>

<p>
Where many men work and starve, and many work and turn into cabbages,
and many steal and turn into rats, and a few own the land and turn
into hogs.
</p>

<p>
Where nature is not as important as law.
</p>

<p>
Where law is cause rather than effect.
</p>

<p>
Where religion is faith rather than affirmation.
</p>

<p>
Where love is never as strong as things.
</p>

<p>
Where age is decay rather than more life.
</p>

<p>
Where art is encouraged but not recognized.
</p>

<p>
Where revolt is the strongest of emotions and the weakest of actions.
</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p class="noindent">
What do you call this strange place where it is immoral to take life
deeply, and moral to be a half-thing?
</p>

<p>
Where it is beautiful to have theories of living, and ugly to apply them.
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-2" class="pagenum" title="2"></a>
Where it is right to dabble and wrong to realize.
</p>

<p>
Where ignorance is a virtue and knowledge a crime.
</p>

<p>
Where nature is obscenity and man’s abuse of it purity.

Soul-Sleep and Modern Novels

<p class="first">
<span class="firstchar">A</span><span class="postfirstchar">n</span> American novelist who wanted sales, and who was willing to sacrifice
all but the core of his character to get sales, found himself
recently in a challenging situation. As he expressed it:
</p>

<p>
“Along about page two hundred in the copy of the novel I am on, the
woman’s soul wakes up.”
</p>

<p>
“A woman’s novel?” I asked.
</p>

<p>
“Meant to be,” said he. “Study of a woman all through. Begins as a
little girl—different, you know—sensitive, does a whole lot of thinking
that her family doesn’t follow. Tries to tell ’em at first, but finds herself
in bad. Then keeps quiet for years—putting on power and beauty in the
good old way of bumps and misunderstanding. She’s pure white fire presently—body
and brain—something else asleep. She wants to be a mother,
but the ghastly sordidness of the love stories of her sisters to this enactment,
frightens her from men and marriage as the world conducts it——”
</p>

<p>
“I follow you,” said I.
</p>

<p>
“Well, I’m not going to do the novel here for you,” he added. “You
wouldn’t think there was a ray of light in it from this kind of telling. A man
who spends five months of his best hours of life in telling a story, can’t
do it over in ten minutes and drive a machine at the same time——”
</p>

<p>
“We’re getting out of the crowd. What does the girl do?” I asked.
</p>

<p>
“Well, she wanted a little baby—was ready to die for it, but had her
own ideas of what the father should be. A million married women have
thought the same thing here in America—pricked the obscene sham of the
whole business but too late. Moreover they’re the best women we’ve got.
There are——”
</p>

<p>
He actually shook the hat off his head—back into the seat at this point.
</p>

<p>
“There are some young women coming up into maturity here in America—God
bless ’em—who are almost brave enough to set out on the Quest
for the Father of the baby that haunts them to be born.... That’s
what she did.
</p>

<p>
“He was a young man doing his own kind of work—doctoring among
the poor, let us say, mainly for nothing—killing himself among men and
women and babies; living on next to nothing, but having a half-divine kind
of madness to lift the world.... She saw him. You can picture
that. They were two to make one—and a third. She knew. There was a
gold light about his head for her eyes. Some of his poor had seen it. The
young man himself didn’t know it, and the world missed it altogether.
</p>

<p>
“She went to him. It’s cruel to put it this way.... I’m not
saying anything about the writing or about what happened, but the scene
<a id="page-8" class="pagenum" title="8"></a>
as it came to me was the finest thing I ever saw. We always fall down
in the handling, you know.... I did it the best I could....
No, I’m not going to tell you what happened. Only this: A little afterward—along
about page two hundred of the copy—her soul woke up.”
</p>

<p>
“Why not, in God’s name?”
</p>

<p>
He glanced quickly at me as a man does from ahead, when his car is
pressing the limit.
</p>

<p>
“Ever have a book fail?” he asked.
</p>

<p>
“Seven,” said I.
</p>

<p>
He cleared his throat and the kindest smile came into his eyes.
</p>

<p>
“They tell me at my publisher’s that I slowed up my last book badly—by
taking a woman’s soul out for an airing—just a little invalid kind of
a soul, too. Souls don’t wake up in American novels any more. You can’t
do much more in print nowadays than you can do on canvas—I mean movie
canvas. Of course, you can paint soul, but you can’t photograph it—that’s
the point. The movies have put imagination to death. We have to compete.
You can’t see a soul without imagination—or some sort of madness—and
the good people who want imagination in their novels don’t buy ’em.
They rent or borrow. It’s the crowds that go to the movies that have
bright colored strings of American novels, as the product runs—on their
shelves—little shiny varnished shelves—red carpets—painted birds on the
lampshades and callers in the evenings....”
</p>

<p>
There was a good silence.
</p>

<p>
“Do you know,” he said presently, “I’ve about come to the conclusion
that a novel must play altogether on sensuous tissue to catch the crowd?
Look at the big movie pictures—the actors make love like painted animals....
I’m not humorous or ironical. It’s a big problem to me——”
</p>

<p>
“Why, you can’t touch the hem of the garment of a real love story
until you are off the sensuous,” I offered. “The Quest only begins there.
I’m not averse to that. It belongs in part. We are sensuous beings—in
part. But I am averse to letting it contain all. Why, the real glow
comes to a romance—when a woman’s soul wakes up. There’s a hotter
fire than that which glows blood-red——”
</p>

<p>
“I know,” he said quickly. “I know. That blood-red stuff is the cheapest
thing in the world, but that’s where the great thing called human interest
lives.... I’m sure of this story until her soul wakes up. She stirs
in her sleep, and I see a giantess ahead—the kind of woman who could
whistle to me or to you—and we’d follow her out—dazed by the draw of
her. They are in the world. I reckon souls do wake up—but I can feel
the public dropping off every page after two hundred—like chilled bees—dropping
off page by page—and the old familiar battle ahead. I can feel
that tight look about the eyes again——”
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-9" class="pagenum" title="9"></a>
“Are you going to put her soul back to sleep?” I asked, as we turned
again into the crowd.
</p>

<p>
I wasn’t the least lordly in this question. I knew his struggle, and
something of the market, too. I was thinking of tradesmen—how easy it
is to be a tradesman; in fact, how difficult it is to be otherwise—when
the very passion of the racial soul moves in the midst of trade.
</p>

<p>
“She’s beautiful—even asleep,” he said. “I’m afraid I’ll have to give
her something. I’m building a house. She’s in the comprehension of the
little varnished shelves—asleep.”
</p>

<p>
“Doesn’t a tight look come about the eyes—from much use of that
sort of anæsthetic?” I asked.
</p>

<p>
“Let’s get a drink,” he answered.

Richard Aldington’s Poetry
</h2>

</div>

<p class="aut">
<span class="smallcaps">Amy Lowell</span>
</p>

<p class="first">
<span class="firstchar">W</span><span class="postfirstchar">hat</span> a melancholy thing it is to have to admit that one of our national
traits so often interferes with our appreciation of the fine arts, and
therefore with the pleasure and profit to be derived from them! As a nation,
we are dreadfully impressed by noise. The loud and compelling, even if the
blatant, is sure to attract our attention. It is as though we were tone-deaf
to all instruments save those of percussion, and colour-blind to all except the
primary colours.
</p>

<p>
This is a particularly unsatisfactory condition, as we are really of a very
welcoming temper. We are as anxious to make friends in art as in life.
We have no quarrel with originality; on the contrary, it is decidedly pleasing
to us. But our sympathies are bounded by our capacities, and our capacities
are to a great extent limited to the perception of loud tones and crude colours.
To teach the public to hear semi tones and see half-shades, perhaps that is
one of the functions of the Imagist poets.
</p>

<p>
I suppose it is this preoccupation with what Walter Scott used to call
“the big, bow-wow style,” which has kept Richard Aldington’s work from
being as well understood here as it is in England. The very delicacy of it;
its elusiveness, in which suggestions appear and disappear like a blowing
mist; its faint, gradually changing colour; all these things confuse the
average American poetry lover. While a few people find in Mr. Aldington’s
work poetry of a most exquisite and stimulating kind, the great mass of
readers turn away bewildered.
</p>

<p>
This is inconceivable to me. How is it that we do not notice that a man
is standing beside us unless he digs us in the ribs with an aggressive elbow?
Our own country-woman, who writes under the pen-name of H. D., has had
to contend with much of the same partial understanding, and it remained for
an Englishman, Mr. Aldington himself, to write an explanation and appreciation
of her work in an American magazine—this magazine. It is time
that an American should explain to her countrymen the work of the Englishman,
who is Richard Aldington.
</p>

<p>
Water and poetry have a quality in common. They both have a way of
seeping—seeping, and without apparent flow, arriving. We are constantly
finding fault with American publishers for permitting English firms to bring
out the first books of our authors; it is to the honour of America that Richard
Aldington’s first book is to appear in the autumn, with the imprint of
an American house.
</p>

<p>
Indeed, in speaking of the non-understanding of the mass of American
readers and reviewers, I must add the paradox that the minority here is
quicker to perceive excellence than the people of any other country. It is
<a id="page-12" class="pagenum" title="12"></a>
our own magazine <em>Poetry</em>, with its far-seeing and daring editor, who first
introduced Mr. Aldington to a considerable public, and her lead was quickly
followed by <span class="smallcaps">The Little Review</span>; an American firm, the Boni’s, printed a
number of his poems in an Anthology: <em>Des Imagistes</em>; and another American
firm, Messrs. Houghton Mifflin, printed others in <em>Some Imagist Poets</em>. So
Mr. Aldington’s work has seeped little by little to where we can look at it as
a reflecting lake. More sputtering brooks of poetry have brawled away and
disappeared, but Mr. Aldington’s output lies placid and arresting before us.
</p>

<p>
What is the quality of this work which makes it at once eluding and enduring?
I think it is stark, unsentimental preoccupation with beauty. Mr.
Aldington is in love with beauty. “Not,” to quote Leigh Hunt, “in the little
present-making style, with baskets of new fruit and pots of roses, but with
consuming passion.” There is nothing pretty about this poetry; it is not
prettiness, but beauty, that the poet is after.
</p>

<p>
This naked beauty Mr. Aldington found in the Greeks. One feels
that his youth was passed in a kind of painful homesickness, the nostalgia
of a beauty which he could not then see about him. Greek poetry and
Italian landscape gave him ease, and, solaced and flowering, his first work
was under their influence.
</p>

<p>
I do not know which of Mr. Aldington’s poems first saw the light of
day in <em>Poetry</em>, and I have not the volumes here to refer to. But the first
collection of his poems in <em>Des Imagistes</em> shows this preoccupation with Greek
themes. All of the poems are Greek in feeling, many of them have Greek
titles and are perfectly Greek in content. Take this one, for instance:

The objectors say that that is merely a copy. It lays itself open to that
criticism, certainly, but how exquisite a copy. And how difficult to make
such a copy! Try it and see! Mr. Aldington is a master of suggestion.
His descriptions are never overloaded, and yet there is the picture. In the
next stanza to the last, notice the blowing, rippling linen over the white
bodies of the young girls.
</p>

<p>
A little of this goes a long way, you say. Yes, I think that is true, but
Mr. Aldington has other strings to play. He has irony, a not-too-common
trait in modern poetry. I know few things more beautiful, and more ironical
than this:

Even in this first collection we see that the Greek awakening was a real
awakening, and that once taught to see, the poet can go on seeing. The
charge of copying is unfair. There is no “copying” in this:

      <div class="stanza">
      <p class="verse">I have sat here happy in the gardens,</p>
      <p class="verse">Watching the still pool and the reeds</p>
      <p class="verse">And the dark clouds</p>
      <p class="verse">Which the wind of the upper air</p>
      <p class="verse">Tore like the green leafy boughs</p>

      <p class="verse">And the pale yellow grasses</p>
      <p class="verse">Among them.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">
I think that is one of the best poems which Mr. Aldington has done.
“The rose and white colour of the smooth flag-stones” almost sets me
weeping too, so desolate are they, with the yellow grasses growing up between
them.
</p>

<p>
I suppose the thing which is so satisfying in Mr. Aldington’s work is
the intense feeling which underlies the astringent utterance. With all his
stern, uncompromising technique (for Mr. Aldington is a remarkable technician)
goes a passionate violence of feeling. The Imagists are constantly
accused of being inhuman, mere intellectuals. How strange it is that the
feeling which merely turns white and makes no movement should go unperceived,
while hysterical screams and lamentations, over in a moment, pass
for the outpourings of true passion! What we have outgrown on the stage
still holds in poetry, it seems.
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-15" class="pagenum" title="15"></a>
Feeling there surely is in <em>Childhood</em>, printed in <em>Some Imagist Poets</em>.
Yet, somehow, the poem is not as good as it ought to be. I suspect that
Mr. Aldington has not yet quite mastered the technique of the long poem.
Feeling is there, and we get the dullness of the little town perfectly, and the
stale, salt smell of the harbour; and there are excellent descriptions—the
public park, and the wonderful box in the attic—but the poem as a whole
does not “get over.” Necessarily more discursive than the shorter poems, it
has not enough command of the dramatic to succeed. Having taught himself
for years to say things in the fewest possible words, the length of this
poem has weakened the poet’s method. He must study the requirements of
the longer poem a little more before he will be quite at home in it. Such
as it is, <em>Childhood</em> is interesting as showing the broadening of its author’s
mind and interests. He no longer sees with the eyes of other centuries; he
sees things about him, and as they are.

      <p class="verse">The shining of the sun upon the water</p>

Of all the poems which Mr. Aldington has written, <em>The Poplar</em> is certainly
the most generally liked. And I am not prepared to say that the public
is not right. Perhaps it really is the best, I don’t know. I am very fond
of it.

very modern, aching, and inevitable. But I will give one more little piece

This is sophisticated poetry. How often have I not read that in the
reviews, couched in terms of reproach! Why? Is it to be desired that the
world should not grow? Is it a better art which appeals only to primitive
instincts? The primary needs of satisfying hunger, preserving life, procreating
life, are all very well, but civilized man has further preoccupations.
Mr. Aldington’s is a highly civilized—yes, if you like, a highly sophisticated,
art. A certain mellowness of temper is needed to thoroughly appreciate it;
crude minds do not react to such delicate stimuli. Admitting that, and admitting
it as a feather, not as a rotten egg, we have in Mr. Aldington a lyrist
of unusual achievement and fine promise.

        <p class="verse2">It was a cab, worn, withered, and blighted.</p>
    <p class="verse">A man like a moth-eaten</p>

    <p class="verse">Sat on the box of the crazy thing.</p>
    <p class="verse">Obviously it had been through Hell;</p>
    <p class="verse">But its inside was musty and threadbare</p>
    <p class="verse">As though companies of faded virgins</p>
    <p class="verse">Had ridden in it for generations.</p>
    <p class="verse">The horse, as you looked at him from the sidewalk,</p>
    <p class="verse">Staggered with all four legs;</p>
    <p class="verse">But to one sitting inside the cab</p>
    <p class="verse">He must have seemed so thin of beam</p>
    <p class="verse">As to vanish altogether.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="stanza">
        <p class="verse2">The Archangel Gabriel was inclined to stoutness</p>
    <p class="verse">And wore a well-preserved Derby hat.</p>
    <p class="verse">He drove through the night incredulously,</p>
    <p class="verse">With vague haltings</p>
    <p class="verse">As if ready to be struck dumb</p>

    <p class="verse">As though they would have accepted anything</p>
    <p class="verse">That could carry them swiftly or slowly</p>
    <p class="verse">Away from the insupportable</p>
    <p class="verse">Oppression of Here and Now.</p>
    <p class="verse">They bundled into the cab,—</p>
    <p class="verse">Four of them—</p>
    <p class="verse">Two, whose glass throats were wound with wire and silver</p>

    <p class="verse">Drove his precarious vehicle to the entrance of the Park</p>
    <p class="verse">And straight down</p>
    <p class="verse">Into the depths of the sea.</p>
    <p class="verse">Through watery glooms</p>
    <p class="verse">And swift gleams as of wave-light,—</p>

    <p class="verse">Aped the summer swaying of terrestrial foliage,</p>

    <p class="verse">Huge branches of coral</p>

    <p class="verse">There was the cab,—</p>
    <p class="verse">And lo! of the two ghostly passengers,</p>
    <p class="verse">One had become an undulant mermaid</p>

Emma Goldman on Trial
</h2>

</div>

<p class="aut">
<span class="smallcaps">Louise Bryant</span>
</p>

<p class="first">
<span class="firstchar">J</span><span class="postfirstchar">ust</span> about the time that one Portland, Oregon, newspaper had smugly
remarked, editorially, that Portland was far ahead of many other cities
in its treatment of Emma Goldman in that it ignored her altogether, pandemonium
broke loose. Within a few days, that paper and all the others in
town gave Miss Goldman such front page notices and such flaring headlines
that the war in Europe seemed quite an insignificant thing compared to
the peril which seemed to be threatening the “Rose City” on account of
her presence in our midst.
</p>

<p>
The apparent reason for this agitation was that one little, old woman
by the name of Mrs. Josephine Johnson had heard through a friend, whose
name she refused to divulge (even when so ordered by the court) that on
the evening of the lecture on Friedrich Nietzsche somebody had distributed
a pamphlet on birth control.
</p>

<p>
The real reason for the arrest was that the police wished to break up
the meeting. They had previously sent Miss Goldman a notice that she
could not speak any more in Portland on any subject whatever. This order
could never have been carried out as we have free speech in Portland, so
they used another method.
</p>

<p>
Miss Goldman and Dr. Reitman were arrested on the evening of August
6 just after the meeting began, and at 10:30 at night all bail except cash
was refused, which is contrary to all idea of justice. But for the efforts of
Mr. C. E. S. Wood, who has always been a staunch friend of all free-thinkers,
Miss Goldman would have been thrown into jail in a city where
she has been allowed to lecture every year for nearly twenty years and
where her friends have come to look forward to her annual visits as we do
to all the other good things that come to us, like the spring and the rain
and the sunshine; for of just such healing and life-giving qualities are her
inspirational messages.
</p>

<p>
There were two trials. The first was the usual sort and really is of
small interest. At this trial held in the Municipal court, Miss Goldman and
Dr. Reitman were found guilty of distributing obscene literature and fined
$100 each. As a matter of fact, Miss Goldman knew nothing about the distribution
of the leaflet, but she certainly would have approved of it if she had.
</p>

<p>
This sentence of the lower court was promptly appealed, and in the
second trial, which took place in Dept. 5 of the Circuit court under Judge
William N. Gatens, the case was dismissed for lack of evidence.
</p>

<p>
When we remember that one of our bravest rebels, Margaret Sanger,
will soon have to face a trial on a similar charge we can only hope, vainly
<a id="page-26" class="pagenum" title="26"></a>
and wildly perhaps, that she will be fortunate enough to have a presiding
judge as fair-minded as Judge Gatens.
</p>

<p>
Some of his remarks were so refreshing, coming as they did in such
fine defiance of the usual attitude of those on the bench towards those who
are accused, that they are worthy of quoting:
</p>

<p>
During the trial Judge Gatens said:
</p>

<p>
“The Court says the defendants are not here charged, as has been stated
by the council, with creating anarchistic tendencies, or with being anarchists;
they are here to be charged for the offense set forth in the information and
for no other offense.
</p>

<p>
“Every person, when charged with a crime, should have the right to
know the nature of the crime with which he is charged, meet the witnesses
face to face, and be tried without prejudice; not to be tried on the ground
that you don’t like this person or that person because they have some view
different from yours.
</p>

<p>
“Now it seems to me that the trouble with our people today is that
there is too much prudery. Ignorance and prudery are the millstones about
the neck of progress. Everyone knows that. We are all shocked by many
things publicly stated that we know privately ourselves, but we haven’t got
the nerve to get up and admit it; and when some person brings our attention
to something we already know, we feign modesty and we feel that the
public has been outraged and decency has been shocked when as a matter
of fact we know all these things ourselves.
</p>

<p>
“I am a member of the Oregon Hygiene Society. We get out literature
and place it in the toilets all over the state, telling people how to guard
against the evils of venereal diseases and so forth. We do that for the uplift
of humanity, to protect society from all those things, and the public does
not seem to be very much shocked about it.”

Poetry Versus Imagism
</h2>

</div>

<p class="aut">
<span class="smallcaps">Huntly Carter</span>
</p>

<p class="note">
<em>I entirely disagree with Mr. Carter’s point of view—as much of it as
I can fathom. But I hope his article will provoke discussion that will lead
to clearer understanding of the Imagist’s art in a country where even poets
are blind to it. Mr. Carter states his position briefly as follows: “The
Imagists claim that the subjects with which they deal find a completer and
more adequate poetical expression in the Imagist form than in any other.
Granting that this is so, the question still remains whether this form is
essential to poetry or whether it tends to exclude poetry. So one has to
consider what poetry really is and what it implies. My article is designed
for this purpose.” How horrible!—to treat miracles like this!—The Editor.</em>
</p>

<p class="first">
<span class="firstchar">A</span> few years ago I went to the Falkland Islands to sheep-farm for a
bare subsistence, and while living on a lonely station twenty miles from
everywhere, so to speak, tending my flock, what time the half-breeds came
and helped themselves to my humble belongings, I experienced a new emotion.
Perhaps it would be more correct to say I became aware of the nature
of an old emotion. I felt the currents of transcendent energy which I felt
in my childhood. But I now felt them more frequently, and I saw that I
was elevated by them beyond the normal course of every-day life. At such
moments I forgot the sheep, the pastures and the marauding half-breeds.
I even forgot the strong colour and form of nature. I saw something ridding
me of solid things and leaving nothing but a fluid universe. I saw distinct
forms melting to formative motions. I had been caught in the midst of
an intense current—a transforming current of livingness. Moreover, I
was free to the current, with the result that I became a part of itself—fluid—unresistingly,
and was actuated accordingly. For the time being, I moved
as the fluid element most moved me. Later reflection showed me that I was
moved by some ineffable thing which I believe to be poetry. It may be that
the soul is made of poetry, and after the human soul has freed itself from the
fetters of materialism it becomes re-converted to poetry; that is, a part of its
own flow or motion. I do not think materialists will understand this. But
it will be clear to the spiritual minded.
</p>

<p>
I am sure that the hypothesis, that poetry is simply soul-stuff, is a verifiable
one. I am convinced that in my Falkland Island days, whenever I was
raised by intensity out of my material self at a higher level than actuality,
whenever such intensity annihilated time and space, obliterated that personality
which I call Huntly Carter, lifted me to the infinite and eternal and
left me dumb, I was experiencing poetry. I know that the hypothesis involves
<a id="page-28" class="pagenum" title="28"></a>
two assumptions. First, that poetry cannot be written. It can only
be expressed in motion or action. And it can only be expressed by the person
who receives it direct from its source or fount. Hence a significant poet
is not one who writes verse, but one who lives poetry, <em>is</em> poetry. The second
assumption is that every human being who possesses the smallest soul vibration
possesses a poetry-sense, and is, in fact, a potential poet. Given
absolute freedom, he, too, would become poetry, such is the power of conversion
residing in the element waiting to operate upon him. Which is not
absurd when we come to think of it.
</p>

<p>
I find I am not alone in the attempt to rescue poetry from the lumber
heap of verbalism and verbalists, to say nothing of verbiage, and to restore
it to the infinite. I remember reading in an early number of the London
<em>Poetry Review</em> that life has a rhythmic origin and poetry resides first of all
in the rhythms of motion and sound. Of course “sound” is redundant, seeing
that sound is the result of motion. I read further that poetry ultimately
finds its way into language as the vocal expression of the fundamental motion
or rhythm. Could anything be clearer? We feel the motion or rhythm
and act it. And we attempt to express it in words in the last resort. Perhaps,
some day nearer the millennium, it will be discovered that language
(verbal of course) is the last resort of the poetically destitute.
</p>

<p>
The gist of what I read was this: First, poetry is the transmutation
of some natural element (motion, sound or what not) into simple emotion
(motion passing into e-motion). Then as the generic emotions pass beyond
the senses they are handled by the intellect. One knows what the intellect
does. Being peculiarly constituted to submit everything to scrutiny and
analysis, it seizes upon the vague and indefinable characters of the human
feelings and attempts the impossible task of analyzing their composition and
stating their quantity and quality with precision. (Note what great emphasis
the Imagists place upon the value of precision.) In other words, the
intellect sets to work to regulate poetry by form and law. (Again, note how
the Imagists emphasize the importance of form and law.) I suppose only
the poet who proceeds upon instinct and despises methodical verse-making,
recognizes the stupidity of trying to express poetry in terms of intellectual
states of mind. To him, the vision of poetry in terms of cerebralism can
only have one effect, namely, to kill poetry.
</p>

<p>
After reading this explanation of poetry, I felt I ought to credit the
writer with a desire to exalt poetry to the Infinite. First, however, it was
necessary to determine what he meant by the process of “transmutation.”
If he meant the activity of the “thing” which I call poetry, and not the
“thing” itself; if he was thinking of the change effected in the poet’s soul
after it has received the rhythmic element which effects the change; then
poetry to him was clearly the operation and not the operating agent. Further,
there was the individualizing meaning to be considered. Let us assume
that the poet’s soul receives rhythms or vibrations from the Infinite, which
<a id="page-29" class="pagenum" title="29"></a>
it instantly converts into its own. Just as a magnetic needle receives its own
currents and points aright. Where is one to look for poetry? Is it the vibrations
themselves, or is it the act of conversion? I sought the answer in
the writer’s own words that “poetry resides first of all in the rhythms or
motion,” and I concluded that he was not making a precise use of the word
“transmutation.” So I was able to relate his explanation of poetry to one I
had published somewhere in <em>The New Freewoman</em>. This was my explanation.
There is a creative force underlying all phenomena. At an early period
of the world’s history when self-ownership was real—not a dream—man
was provoked by this force into poetic action. The force operated by dissolving
man into its own and thereby exalting him mystically. But as man
became more and more intellectual, so gradually he lost the power of being
dissolved, and provoked into mystical action. With the result that he invented
words to take the place of action. And as this process of degeneration
continued, so he evolved substitutes—paid actors, poets, painters—to do
for him what he had lost the power to do for himself. Thus the verbal poet
is simply a projection of man’s lost capacity to poetize himself and for himself.
That is, the power to obliterate himself physically. I need not go into
this point further. If necessary, I could show that many human activities
and most human institutions are symptomatic of the long drawn-out diseases
of self-suppression and self-annihilation. Mind, I speak of the spiritual self
and not that usually confused with a corporeal nature.
</p>

<p>
This rather long but necessary preface brings me to another and more
recent attempt to recover the old emotion. I refer to my recent experience
with <em>The Egoist</em> and the subject of Imagism in its relation to poetry. I suppose
most intelligent persons are inquiring what Imagism and <em>The Egoist</em>
have to do with each other. <em>The Egoist</em> is obviously, as its name implies,
a journal devoted to egoism. And its sub-title informs us that it is an individualistic
review. Of course, egoism is an entirely individualistic affair. It
consists in putting on the armour of self-assertion and defending the special
faith and interests of one’s own. The power that one seeks to win is that
of subjecting material conditions and exacting the utmost spiritual toll from
everything. One pays no regard to the opinion of others, and refuses to
play the part of a cypher, and at the same time refuses to play any part with
others. To stand alone, and with a light heart to do the necessary bargaining
with external influences for the possession of one’s own soul—this, it
seems to me, is the true ground of egoism. Opposed to this is the process
of self-suppression, the process of making bundles of cyphers. When men
obliterate not their corporeal natures but the spiritual part of themselves, by
coming together and acting together, and so juggle the play tricks in order
that they may gain the applause and reward of their fellows, they are cyphers,
not egoists, and deserve to be treated as cyphers. Persons who take this
view of egoism have naturally been watching for the appearance in the
pages of <em>The Egoist</em> of numerous writers with aspirations beyond the group
<a id="page-30" class="pagenum" title="30"></a>
or societal level and not seeing them appear have begun to ask what <em>The
Egoist</em> “stands for.” I believe this question of “standing for” is one which
is hurled at every new and significant journal. One knows that it has been
flung at <span class="smallcaps">The Little Review</span>. There are two ways of answering it. A
journal may show that it does “stand for” something, or it may confound its
critics by claiming the high distinction of not “standing for” anything. Simply
it does not exist in time and space. It exists by the grace of God, so to
speak. As to what <em>The Egoist</em> “stands for,” it is not my concern. The
thing for me to note is that for some issues it has been affected by a very
strong habit of Imagism. Now Imagism is not egoism. I do not think the
Imagists themselves are egoists. To me they appear to be socialists by instinct
and individualists by profession, just as Mr. Bernard Shaw is an individualist
by instinct and a socialist by profession. He is an autocrat with
a democratic lampblack rubbed over his face to commercialize his appearance.
The Imagists are the reverse with the added difference that they use the
polish to beautify rather than commercialize their appearance. In saying this
I do not wish to appear to be attacking the Imagists. On the contrary, I
am anxious to pay them every possible compliment. The fact that they
are sinning against themselves must be its own punishment.
</p>

<p>
The tendency of <em>The Egoist</em> towards Imagism flowered in the May issue.
This issue was in fact “organized” (if I may use a trade term) from cover
to cover to provide an honest and profitable discussion of the so-called “new”
thing in poetry. As if poetry can be new. I had an idea that God made
poetry when the world was very young indeed. Well, I turned to the May
<em>Egoist</em> in order to rediscover my emotion. I found the journal comprised
an admirable treatise on the theory and practice of Imagism with some
uncritical praise and a strong note of criticism thrown in. I read the prose
with a good deal of interest, particularly Mr. Harold Munro’s history, origin
and criticism of Imagism. It seems Mr. Munro objects to Imagism on
the general ground that it is not inspired by the High Muses. It is rather
the work of poets on the way to Parnassus who have stopped half-way to
chase hares. The fact of the matter is that if an Imagist has a passionate
instantaneous impression to start with he does not end with it. He simply
destroys it before he has got very far with intellectual or technical theories.
In Mr. Munro’s very words, “poets of the Imagist and other kindred modern
schools are no longer visited by the Muses: they are not at home to them.”
</p>

<p>
How far this is true one may learn from the Imagists themselves. Here
are some extracts from their contributions to the said “Special Imagist
Number:”
</p>

<div class="excerpt">
<p class="noindent">
“Somewhere in the gleam of the year 1908, Mr. T. E. Hulme, excited by the
propinquity, at a half-a-crown dance of the other sex ... proposed
to a companion that they should found a Poets’ Club. The thing was done,
there and then. The Club began to dine.... In November of the
same year, Edward Storer, ... published the first book of “Imagist
poems.” This statement that the Imagist movement was started by Edward
<a id="page-31" class="pagenum" title="31"></a>
Storer and T. E. Hulme, was subsequently refuted by Mr. Allen Upward who
it seems received the Imagist message in 1900 from “a poet named Cranmer
Byng,” who had received it from Professor Giles, who had brought a tablet
of China from the East with all sorts of wonderful little poems painted
thereon. Later, Mr. Ezra Pound made for Mr. Allen Upward the Imagist
garland to deck his forehead in the Court of Eternity. To continue the extracts,
“Mr. Storer ... was in favor then of a poetry ... described
... ‘as a form of expression, like the Japanese, in which an image
is the resonant heart of an exquisite moment.’” “I (the writer) had been advocating
... a poetry in <em>vers libre</em>, akin in spirit to the Japanese.” ...
“A dissatisfaction with English poetry as it was then being written” led to a
desire “to replace it by the Japanese <em>tanka</em> and <em>haika</em>.” “He (Hulme) insisted
on absolutely accurate presentation and no verbiage” ... “used to
spend hours each day in the search for the right phrase.” ... “We
(the Imagist group) were very much influenced by modern French symbolist
poetry.” “The group died a lingering death at the end of its second winter.”
“He (Pound) had made Imagism to mean pictures as Wyndham Lewis understands
them; writing later for <em>T. P.’s Weekly</em>, “he made it pictures as William
Morris understood them.” So much for the history of Imagism and the expansion
of Mr. Ezra Pound according to Mr. F. S, Flint. One next learns
with regard to Mr. Pound that “he will sincerely work over a few lines of
<em>vers libre</em>.” He “tried to cultivate a sense of style, a feeling for words” ...
“he began to try to make poetry out of the realities of existence.” ...
“he is a ‘bookish’ poet.” ... “It is inevitable that the ‘improved’ and
selected world which the Romantic poet creates should be composed, at least
in part, of ideas, of declaration, of emotions derived from <em>extensive reading</em>.”
If the prizes of this world ... were given to merit ... that poem
deserves the prize usually reserved for some not too revolutionary “honest
craftsman.” Thus Mr. Richard Aldington or Mr. Ezra Pound. Next as to
“H. D.” “The poetry of H. D. has been described as a kind of “accurate
mystery” ... “it has the precision of Goldsmith’s work.” “The things
she (H. D.) has seen and the emotions she has felt have been transmuted in
her mind into an unreality that reveals itself in images of an unsuspected
virtue and in phrases that seem to owe nothing to common speech.” ...
“A poet who will accept nothing that has not come to her direct.” ...
“Her ceaseless scrutiny of the word and phrase.” “A tendency to pare and
cut too far.” It is Mr. F. S. Flint who writes. From the next article one
gathers that “every poet must seek anew for himself, out of the <em>language</em>
medium at his disposal, rhythms which are adequate and forms which are
expressive of his own unique personality.” And again, “what will teach us
most is our <em>language</em> and life.” “He (Mr. Fletcher) is seen at his best where
fancy, imagination, musical ingenuity, verbal magic, and a curious feeling for
the landscape of Chinese painting are fused in an intriguing and quite beautiful
lyric sequence.” Mr. Ferris Greenslet is writing on the poetry of John
Gould Fletcher.

<p class="noindent">
I have quoted sufficient to indicate the history, aim, scope and methods
of Imagism as set forth by the Imagists. Perhaps I should add an extract
or two (also in inverted commas) from Mr. Harold Munro’s contribution.
</p>

<div class="excerpt">
<p class="noindent">
“Their (the Imagists’) insistence on the necessity of an absolutely fresh
start in poetry.” They claim to have discovered “poetry as an Art.” They
devoted their energies solely to the cultivation of new form and the adoption
<a id="page-32" class="pagenum" title="32"></a>
of a renovated language oblivious of the fact that Idea must primarily dictate
both.” “The forms they still felt they might use, the vocabulary that remained
at their disposal, were extremely limited.” They had thrown so much good
material away “that they remained now almost unprovided with a language or
a style.” It looks as though they threw away the baby with the bath water.
So they divided. “Some decided to tolerate the old subjects, but to discover
a new manner of presenting or representing, them; others, not so satisfied,
probed nervously the psychological recesses of the New World and dragged out
all the strangest rags of fancy they could find, exhibiting them solely on account
of their whimsical colour and shapes. Further, “they do not profess
to sing.” (Neither does modern commerce). They swear by “the best of
intellect.” “Their minds are obsessed by the Town.” They acclaim the “passing
event.” They suspect the “beauties of poetry.” “The method of the
Imagists is to model little detached patterns of words.” One of their principles
seems to suggest “that if one first design a poem, then the idea will be present
by reason of the design.” This recalls the principle of certain theatre
reformers that if one builds a new theatre a new form of drama will enter
crowned with daisies. It is equal to saying that given a donkey’s tail the
donkey will be present because of the tail.
</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">
After reading the Imagists’ theories I read their verse. Without, however,
recovering my emotion. It left me cold. I asked myself if poetry had
ceased to run through me. Was I no longer its agent? Had intellect interposed
to censor it—with form? In other words, was my conception of
poetry wrong? Was the Imagists’ conception wrong? Then I remembered
that when I first experienced poetry and became aware of what I experienced,
and when I began to express what I experienced, I proceeded on the
principle of not mixing with my expressed experience any intellectual elements
of thought, idea, reason or what not. I simply allowed some element
to flow through me, and myself to be actuated by the flow. To me poetical
expression was really an abstraction of the individualizing features of a
spiritual experience received and transmitted in an instant of time. It expressed
a creative movement abstracted from a creative movement, just as
a subconscious drawing externalizes certain vibrations received through a
magnetic medium. This creative movement appointed me its receiver that
I might impart a momentary outwardness and sensational reality to its external
content. Actually I was saturated with this precious element as a
sponge can be saturated with rich perfume, and like the sponge was prepared
to saturate in turn. In my belief, poetry is this spiritually saturating
element. I would say it is a unifying element, bringing a like element in
each of us into a unity of Soul or Spirit-consciousness. That is, the consciousness
of Soul states which transcend this sordid material life in which
we are so deeply immersed. I can imagine a true poet saturated by this element
having glimpses of a supreme and superb Being, and thus entering
consciously into that state of Being. But I cannot possibly imagine such a
poet finding poetic expression in pots and pans and tup’ny tubes, and the
confused and meaningless odds and ends of material life. I know there are
certain poets who claim they have poetry in them, and because of this, they
<a id="page-33" class="pagenum" title="33"></a>
can poetize any object. Just, as I suppose, the bee can pour forth honey
on any object, or wine can be used to adulterate water. But, of course, the
honey does not change the object into honey, nor the wine turn the water
into wine, any more than the poetry element poured forth lavishly can transmute
a motor-car or any dead thing into living poetry. Indeed, all that
poets, obsessed by the theory of poetizing town and kitchen stuff, really do,
is to waste their precious possession. Actually they precipitate their sweet
scent on a concrete floor. If such poets ever hope to take the Golden Road
they must leave shrieking machinery alone and cease pouring the perfumes
of Araby over cancrous civilization. They must leave perishable things to
perishable minds and fit out an expedition to the Inner Self. Thereby they
may hope to return wet with the poetic spirit. In other words, they will
return with rich experiences lit by the flame of poetry. It seems then that
the reason I could not feel the Imagist verse was because I was trying it
by a law or principle which told me that poetry makes itself felt through
the senses, not through the intellect. Furthermore, it makes itself felt not
only by passionately initiating us into some mystery or other of reality, but
by making us an active part of that mystery. The poet is a signature of
poetic reality.
</p>

<p>
I do not say this is the ultimate test of poetry. It may be that poetry is
so indefinable as to elude all tests. Again it may be that this very indefinableness
is the test of poetry. The secret in its motion cannot be analyzed.
One cannot explain it any more than one can explain the odor of a flower.
One is aware of it—that is all. Yet, I may ask, how does the Imagist poetry
stand my test? The first thing one notices in the poetry is its air of cerebrality
verging on cerebralitis. Accordingly one discovers an inordinate
love of the intellectual qualities of style, and consequently, a feverish quest
for figures. So there are figures of every kind. Condensing and visualizing
figures, figures of similarity, contiguity and contrast, figures describing and
analyzing perishable things. There is in fact a profusion of figures having
one characteristic in common, namely, a straining after novelty, originality
and freshness. If for the sake of argument one admits that poetry can be
expressed in words, of course one admits that poetry can be expressed in
images or figures of speech. But this is not to say that figures of speech are
consequently poetry. Otherwise every bit of foolish verse that has ever
been written could lay claim to the imperishable Garland. Every tup’ny
box would be entitled to arrest each passer-by with a cry of “Behold the
poetry in me.”

I could quote thousands of similar figures. I do not, however, accept
them as poetry, simply because they do not give me poetry. I dare say
the Imagists would refuse to accept them as poetry, but on a different
ground. No doubt they would say that many of these figures have been
manufactured in the wrong place. They have been made in the cerebrum
instead of in the Imagist quarter, the cerebellum. They are in fact suffering
from cerebritis whereas nowadays the proper complaint is cerebralitis. So
the Imagists would complain that such figures do not conform to their conception
of poetry as <em>an Art</em>. The ideas in them are not expressed as they
would express them. There is an absence of clarity, precision, novelty,
freshness, originality and so on. Change the form from cerebriform to cerebraform,
<a id="page-35" class="pagenum" title="35"></a>
clip the words, remove the clichés, stop the singing, bring the image
up to the quick-lunch standard and most of the figures would pass the
Imagist test. All this is very pretty. But when all is said I do not see
why some of the figures may not pass the test as they stand. When Mr.
Hulme wants to describe a nature experience he does it in this lengthy
fashion:
</p>

<div class="excerpt">
  <div class="poem-container">
    <div class="poem">
      <div class="stanza">
      <p class="verse">A touch of cold in the autumn night</p>
      <p class="verse">I walked abroad,</p>
      <p class="verse">And saw the ruddy moon lean over a hedge,</p>
      <p class="verse">Like a red-faced farmer.</p>
      <p class="verse">I did not stop to talk, but nodded;</p>
      <p class="verse">And round about were the wistful stars</p>
      <p class="verse">With white faces like town children.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">
The similitude of a “red-faced farmer” does not raise the subject to heights.
It is entirely lacking in dignity, is commonplace, and suggests ludicrous
associations. For instance, much beer and a hot game of skittles.
</p>

<p>
When Browning does it he gets to work in a businesslike manner:
</p>

<div class="excerpt">
  <div class="poem-container">
    <div class="poem">
      <div class="stanza">
      <p class="verse">The sun looked over the water’s brim</p>
      <p class="verse">And straight there was a path of gold for him</p>
      <p class="verse">And a world of souls for me.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">
I quote from memory, but I believe I quote correctly. The image is expressed
with brevity, clearness, and dignity. Keats’s way of expressing the
experience is:
</p>

<div class="excerpt">
  <div class="poem-container">
    <div class="poem">
      <div class="stanza">
      <p class="verse">I who still saw the universal sun</p>
      <p class="verse">Heave his broad shoulder o’er the edge of the world</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">
The similitude of “heaving the shoulder” is open to the same objection as
that of a “red-faced farmer.” It is undignified. It calls up a vision of the
sun shooting coals down the front cellar.
</p>

<p>
Again, when <a id="corr-11"></a>John Gould Fletcher wants to describe umbrellas in
a new way he refers to them as:
</p>

<div class="excerpt">
  <div class="poem-container">
    <div class="poem">
      <div class="stanza">
      <p class="verse">Bending, recurved blossoms of the storm.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">
And a special movement of rain is exactly described as:
</p>

<div class="excerpt">
  <div class="poem-container">
    <div class="poem">
      <div class="stanza">
      <p class="verse">Uneven tinkling, the lazy rain</p>
      <p class="verse">Dripping from the eaves.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">
The ingenuity of these comparisons takes away Miss Amy Lowell’s
breath. Writing in <em>The New Republic</em> she uses the term “absolutely original.”
And she tells us how well the first figure “makes us see those round,
shining umbrella-tops,” while the second is “a marvel of exact description.”
I dare say Miss Lowell is right. And yet the description, “The news was
<a id="page-36" class="pagenum" title="36"></a>
a dagger to his heart,” was just as original when it was written long, long
ago, and is certainly as vivid and intense in its way as anything by Mr.
Fletcher praised by Miss Amy Lowell.
</p>

<p>
Comparing the new with the old in this way, one may well inquire
whether the new-fashioned Imagists differ so very much from the old-fashioned
ones whom they seek to destroy. For my part, I have no hesitation
in asserting that the subject of the old order of verse does not differ
from that of the new order. If present-day Imagists are bringing a number
of contemporary facts and incidents into figurative employment; if they
cut their particular capers <em>In a Tube</em>, or in <em>My Backgarden</em>, or in a <em>Bath</em>,
or at <em>The Breakfast Table</em>, or amid <em>Slaps</em>, or in <em>Chicago</em>, or in the <em>Pine
Trees’ Tops</em>, or <em>After the Retreat</em>, they are doing precisely what the every-day
Imagist has done with contemporary facts ever since the world began.
So the truth is that subject for subject they are no nearer the Parnassian
height than the mereset babbler of driveling verse. And if they are really
mounting the peaks, if as they claim they are making an absolutely fresh
start at poetry, they are being pushed there by expression or technique, not
poetry. In their view the mere curling and combing of words is sufficient
to elevate them above such common poets as Shakespeare and the rest, and
to entitle them to a seal among the really elect in the poetry business. But,
of course, the bare fact that the Imagists are out for a revolution in form
does not prove that they are out to give us a taste of real poetry. It only
proves they are out for a revolution in form. And if one examines their
form carefully, I believe it will be found to prove that there are poets
among us suffering rather severely from the modern cant disease of culture.
They “know” so much rather than feel anything, and because they know
so much one meets them in every nook and corner, talking incessantly about
the necessity of other poets knowing what they know, and doing as they
do. Indeed they regard the production and advertisement of their particular
kind of goods, which have become a sort of cult among a large number of
persons who believe in hard study and discipline, rather than in spontaneity
and livingness, as the beginning and end of earthly existence. But if one
come to the bottom of the whole business it really amounts to no more than
this. Tennyson and Kipling turned their attention to verse-making. They
did not write poetry. They wrote doggerel, because what they wrote was in
doggerel form. The Imagists have turned their attention to verse-making.
Perhaps it should be versicle-making. They do write poetry. They write
poetry because what they write has a poetry form. In short, the difference
between Tennyson, Kipling and the Imagists is one of form. If the former
had used present-day Imagist form they would be supreme poets. There is
nothing to prove that Tennyson and Kipling could not have cultivated Imagist
form. Therefore Tennyson and Kipling could have written Imagist
verse. They were potentially supreme poets. How anyone can reasonably
pretend that mere form transforms a subject into poetry passes my understanding.
How anyone, moreover, can suggest in cold print that such form
<a id="page-37" class="pagenum" title="37"></a>
is helping to make an absolutely new start in poetry is a point best left to
the decision of mental experts. Still, on reflection, one finds it is all part
of the modern “game” of confusing content with form. One must be grateful
to the Imagists for one thing. For some time there has been a movement
among poets of a certain school to shift the interest from poetry to
themselves considered as deputies. The errors of the Imagists, who, apparently,
are mistaken in their conception of poetry and the business of
poetry, enables one to shift the interest from these poets to poetry itself.
One can say to them, “We are not interested in you, but in poetry. To tell
us that you are deputy receivers and recorders, to describe your aims and
methods, to take us to museums and to invite us to study the fossilized remains
of ancient literatures, is not to help us to enjoy your verse.” Poets
do not get any nearer to poetry by setting up new rulers and standards.
Poetry does not take us farther afield into speculating on form and technique,
but farther from them. Poetry tends to shift the interest from the
poet to itself, from the solid instrument of transmission to the world in
solution. Indeed it tends to obliterate the poet in the physical sense. As
I said it converts him into poetry. Now the reason why Imagism fails as
poetry is precisely because it shifts the interest from the world in solution
to a group of too, too solid poets. My conclusion is obvious. Before the
Imagists can claim that they are making an absolutely new start in poetry,
they must learn to obliterate their corporeal natures. The moment they do
so obliterate themselves, that moment one can safely say “Now we are
coming to poetry.”

<span class="smallcaps">George Burman Foster</span>
</p>

<p class="first">
<span class="firstchar">A</span><span class="postfirstchar">n</span> old philosopher—Aristotle, of course—called man a political being.
By this he meant that man was naturally endowed for society, and,
further, that society could find its full fruition only in the state. To the
old Greek, this political vocation of man seemed great and sublime. Only
<em>one</em> will ruled in the state. This one will synthesized all the individual wills,
no matter how powerful and diverse they were. And this one will made
all the distributive wills strong, and demonstrated its superiority to the
totality of all such wills. The one will wills more than it can do, on that
<a id="page-38" class="pagenum" title="38"></a>
account becomes a statesman, that is, widens out his will to a state-will.
Thus, the one will wins a new and wider sphere for its abilities and activities.
</p>

<p>
But it was the modern—post mediaeval—state which was the first to
set the thought of that impersonal, unemotional philosopher in its true light.
The modern state has brought to consciousness the whole gigantic weight of
the world’s political unfolding of force. The modern state is related to
what the ancient Greeks called state, the Hellenic city-community, much as
one of our mighty industrial machines is related to the primitive tool of a
day-laborer, or a modern machine-gun to the sling and bow of an ancient
warrior. Our states are indeed machines. All their parts fit into each
other with the utmost precision, and work with astonishing accuracy. Our
states are also huge weapons with numberless barrels, but employed by a
single will, unloaded at the word of a single Commander.
</p>

<p>
It was the first chancellor of the German Empire who once asserted at
a meeting of the <em>Reichstag</em> that <em>politics ruined character</em>! This of course
put a damper on all the ardor that lauded to the skies the greatest invention
of modern times, the new miracle of the state. This assertion clangs like
a first elegiac note—like the intimation of an interior fatality, deep-seated
already in the organism of the modern political and cultural life. This word
utters no sentimental fanaticism which, with all sorts of romantic scruples
and moral standards, observes the course of the immense evolution of folk
life. This brave word comes from a man whom the whole world of his
day celebrated as the foremost master of the art of politics. In his hands,
the political machine underwent an unheard-of development of power. And
what this statesman expressed only provisionally perhaps in an ill-humored,
unguarded moment has been meanwhile developed by earnest men to a conscious,
serious concern for men of a new and growing culture. These men
have preached that men should turn aside from political life; they have
seen in spirit a coming day in which state-less, unpolitical man shall have
reached a purer higher stage of life than was at all possible under the banner
of a political culture. <em>Anarchists</em> we today call these warriors against the
state. What they fight, these warriors, is not this or that particular form
of state, not this or that particular institution, but the state in every form,
state in general. But because the word anarchism is ambiguous, because
it is not simply an ancient theory, but occasionally signifies a quite tangible
<em>praxis</em>, we must distinguish between the ideal, the spiritual champions of
anarchism, and the preachers of a propaganda of bloody deed. While, at
best, the latter would only drive out the devil by Beelzebub, the former would
have a noble faith in the victorious power of the idea. Theirs is the high
faith that the might of ideals is mightier than the might of force. They
trust that humanity will overcome the political malady through spiritual
development and inner strength, and will mature in the direction of an
anarchistic culture. And in the rank of these idealistic anarchists, who contemplate
the state as the most grievous hindrance to a noble and pure humanity—a
Prince Kropotkin, a Count Tolstoi, a former German army
<a id="page-39" class="pagenum" title="39"></a>
officer von Egidy—<em>Friedrich Nietzsche</em> also belongs, aye, he leads the van of
all the poets and thinkers who espy the future task of humanity in the negation,
the overcoming, of the state.
</p>

<p>
Anarchism, even in its most ideal form, seems dismal enough to most
men. Yet it is understandable—even a natural necessity—in the evolution
of modern life. It is with the spiritual currents of life as it is with the
vibrations of the pendulum. The stronger the movement toward the one
side, the further the rebound toward the other. As a matter of fact, the
political pendulum has been far removed from the line of equilibrium. The
cultured peoples of Europe—and it was these, not the American people, which
Nietzsche had in mind,—had worked themselves into a political debauch in
which there scarcely seemed to be any other interest than that of politics.
What the Church was to the mediaeval man the state became to the modern
man—God manifest on earth! Men believed in this state as their Christ.
All power in heaven and on earth seemed to be given to it, too. What
was preached in the name of the state was a gospel to its believers. To
these believers it even seemed a sin to doubt the wisdom of the state at all.
It was blasphemy to contest the state’s claim to omnipotence. Once when it
was said: Rome has spoken! all the rest of the world grew dumb in deferential
silence. Later it was said: Paris, Petersburg, Berlin, has spoken! and
a voice from heaven could not have been hearkened to more sacredly than
did political souls take heed to such state edicts. Good? What is good if
not that which benefits the state? Truth? But where is there truth apart
from the word that proceedeth out of the mouth of the state? The political
end sanctifies any means—makes anything good over which men would
be otherwise enraged, stamps anything as true which would be otherwise
branded a lie in the world.
</p>

<p>
Nietzsche hit the nail on the head when he stigmatized the state, in the
sense of his time, as the <em>new idol</em>, and made it say in a Zarathustra discourse;
“On earth there is nothing greater than I: it is I who am the regulative
finger of God”—“everything will it give <em>you</em>, if <em>ye</em> worship it, the new idol.”
And this <em>culture</em> of the state was brought into a system by the philosopher;
it was preached in the pulpit; prayed at the altar. Numberless were the
offerings which were brought to this new idol—of beings, of human happiness
and of human life, aye, of human reason and human conscience! For
whoever serves this idol, whoever would truly serve it, may no longer have
regard for himself, may no longer consult his own judgment. He is the
better fitted to be priest of this state, the less he is burdened with scruples
of his own conscience. He is all the more serviceable a scribe, the more
smoothly he can adapt his well-oiled theology to reasons of state. Truly,
they were not the worst spirits who rebelled against such idolatry. They
were prophets of a new culture who took martyrdom upon themselves, and
no small martyrdom at that, to unhorse a belief in the omnipotence and
omniscience of the state. For this belief oppressed men. Out of men with
living souls, it made ciphers to be added to one so as to give that one worth.
<a id="page-40" class="pagenum" title="40"></a>
Politics needs masses, herds. The individual, the personality, who does not
surrender himself to the masses, who does not think like an animal in a
herd, is troublesome. Therefore, it passes as supreme wisdom of the state
to uniformize all men, to discipline and drill men to whom the sight of a
uniformized mass arouses the feeling of sublime beauty, to whom a thousand-throated
hurrah sounds like the loveliest music. How much tender feeling,
how much inner life, has been stifled in the day’s political alarum—who can
tell? “Yea,” says Nietzsche, “a dying for many hath here been devised,
which glorifieth itself as life: verily, a hearty service unto all preachers
of death!
</p>

<p>
“The state, I call it, where all are poison-drinkers, the good and the bad:
the state where all lose themselves, the good and the bad: the state, where
the slow suicide of all—is called ‘life.’”
</p>

<p>
The sin of the schoolmaster against man as he piles dead history in
the image of the ugliest man upon the present, and blocks his future—all
this has first attained to power and recognition through the political system,
and has thereby become a fatality, an extremity of the cultural life of old
Europe. So Nietzsche saw and said as he looked abroad over the lands and
peoples of his day. Out of the spiritual formation of the individual, the
state made a mechanical drill of the masses. Out of the teacher and educator
of the people, there came to be a master of a school, a slave of a rule, of
a method. The state laid its hand on head and heart—then it needed the
historian to manipulate and adjust history for political purposes. The state
took science into its service—and conquered praise from the mouth of the
artist himself!
</p>

<p>
To seek salvation from political sickness, this is now the redemptive
service of all the men and women to whom man is higher than the state—to
whom <em>the ideals of humanity and of personality</em> are alone sacred and
supreme. The remedy today is what it once was in old Rome: secession,
migration of the spirit to the holy mount of freedom, where the soul breathes
no state air, where it is not suffocated and oppressed by the iron bars of
the state. Secession in art—that means unpolitical art, an art which knows
higher tasks than the glorification of political power, than the erection of
shafts of victory, than promenades of victory! Secession in science—that
means a free university whose teachers, says Nietzsche, do not receive their
appointments through superannuated militarists and ministers of state, <em>a
high school of the spirit</em>, in which there are no political honors and insignia,
but also no state discipline and non-age—a school where everything is
said and taught which an earnest inquiring soul can receive from the world
of nature and of man in earnest responses of his spirit. Secession in religion—that
means, finally, a free church, in which faith is not an official
dictation, but a firm conviction of the inner man, a church where worship
is not an inherited rule and custom, but the heart’s and life’s free expression
in ways of its own. Who will deny that the best and highest which our
day has to show in every sphere of the spirit’s life, must be considered
<a id="page-41" class="pagenum" title="41"></a>
everywhere as a work of secession, of rebellion; that all this has an anarchistic
vein, an unpolitical, antipolitical, yes, a superpolitical stamp? Over
all finer natures there have come a bitter depression and indignation at all
political doing and dickering; they would rather stay and work at home
where no one strives nor cries, than walk the streets so full of the uproar
which politicians make. All souls, turned to within, the clairvoyants of the
spirit and the fine tasters of life agree of course with Nietzsche, that
“where the state ends, there man begins”! The state has its pattern and
uniform for the “many too many,” for the superfluous who in great choruses
bawl of the most superfluous that there is for man. Great souls seek sites
for lone ones and twain ones, they seek them beyond the many too many—there
they sing the songs of that which is necessary for man, the single and
irreplaceable melody, through which man jubilates along to his higher existence.
The state has killed and crushed the peoples, it has summoned into
the world the great lie: “I, the state, am the people.” But there is only one
redemption and convalescence from the state on the part of the people, a
flight “to people who do not understand the state and hate it as an evil
eye and sin in custom and law; which speaks its own tongue of good and
evil and makes its own language of custom and law.” Thus is secession the
emigration from the state into the <em>people</em>; the culture of the future is the
overcoming of the state through the people!
</p>

<p>
To be sure, it is with mixed feelings that we penetrate and interpret
the preaching of the anarchist Nietzsche. The catalogue of sins which, on
a deeper observation of life, we have to charge to state <em>cultus</em> is indeed
great, and hence there is an anarchistic side to the heart of the modern
man, as soon as he thinks of his own rights, as soon as he requires light
and air for the free unfolding of his personality. We know that the state
does not possess eternal life. The state is only a special form in which human
social life can exist, not human society itself. There have not always been
states. They came to be in the long course of the evolution of a people’s
life! What comes to be must pay its toll to Father Time. The state will
change—and pass! Hence it is indeed folly and superstition, it is idolatry,
when we attribute eternal worth to transitory phenomena, and accord them
an unconditional dominion over us.
</p>

<p>
But, for all that, there is the state still; and although we may not say
with Hegel, the special hero of state omnipotence, that all that is real is
rational, yet never is anything that really is, entirely irrational. The state
is still the soil on which we stand and which we till, that it may be able to
receive the seed of the spirit—the state is an evolutionary stage of human
culture. It is a vessel for the reception of the life of the human spirit. It
is one of the conditions of life through which present man must make his
way of necessity, if he is to fulfil his highest destiny. Therefore it is also
folly and superstition, an idolatry of one’s own ego, and of one’s own personality,
if a man thinks he can unfold the wealth of the human by turning
aside from the state. Where the life interests of man solidify to political
<a id="page-42" class="pagenum" title="42"></a>
tendencies, there remains something for the solitary man to see and to learn,
to do and to achieve; and it is a subtle and dangerous temptation when a
man in his solitude proposes to find his satisfaction in the enjoyment of his
books and in the world of his own thoughts and feelings without concern
for the weal or woe of the political body of which he is a member. Politics
is raw to refined natures. But so is all the material with which man labors,
and out of which he fashions what is fine. Let creative spirits make out of
the state a human society in which all human greatness can grow.
</p>

<p>
The idolatry of the state is, like any idolatry, a poison in popular life.
But the antidote which anarchism administers to the present generation, sick
of the state, namely, dominion on the part of the ego, the <em>cultus</em> of the
<em>Ichmensch</em>, does not make the matter better, but perhaps only worse. The
personality of man is indeed his <em>summum bonum</em>, his soul and life; but only
the whole, free, full personality, which feels the pulsations of the common life
of humanity, of the world—only the man to whom, as old Terence said, nothing
human is foreign, because he is in a position to read in all the human the
language and revelation of the eternal. This man is a political being, but
not a political being alone. He has his own soul which he affirms against
any claim of politics and preserves from injury. He lives in the state, but
also above the state. He knows well-springs of being without which the
state would be a desert and dry ground. He is a religious personality who
falls down and supplicates no majesty, because he knows God whom alone
we ought to worship and serve!

<em>Contemporary Portraits, by Frank Harris. New York: Mitchell Kennerley.</em>
</p>

<p class="first">
<span class="firstchar">Y</span><span class="postfirstchar">ou</span> have surely come across that ubiquitous individual who immortalizes
his travels abroad through innumerable “Kodaks,” to be rubbed into
your eyes on every opportune and inopportune occasion. He bores you ad
nauseam. Why? You are offered an opportunity to observe the majestic
Mont Blanc, the smoking Vesuvius, the respectable Eiffel Tower, the San
Marco, the Brandenburg Gate, the Westminster Abbey, and the rest of the
hackneyed wonders. Yet you are nauseated. Your individual has caused
the Kodak to utilize the magnificent views as backgrounds for his own central
figure; you are compelled to seek the Schlangenberg behind the back of
the complacently smiling tourist. A curious rooster strolling over a map is
harmless, until he gets an inspiration to add something of his own.
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-43" class="pagenum" title="43"></a>
With what impatience I have awaited Frank Harris’s <em>Contemporary
Portraits</em>! Not that the name of the “painter” appeals to me tremendously;
I am rather uneasy about the cleverists and the renegades who of late have
found refuge on the hospitable pages of Mr. Viereck’s monthly pamphlet.
But will you consider extravagant my expectation that any portraitist
would reveal exciting things about such unique sitters as Whistler, Wilde,
Verlaine, Swinburne, Maupassant, Maeterlinck, Rodin, France, or about such
remote, semi-legendary personages as Carlyle, Renan, Burton, Browning?—The
book gave me a slap in the face.
</p>

<p>
The very first chapter annoyed me. I could not make myself believe
in the veracity of Mr. Harris’s conversation with Carlyle, which took place
some time in 1877 during a stroll. Mr. Harris is not a bad fiction writer,
but as a hero of his own fiction he appears clumsy. The interview presents
a study in black and white; the black is the crude, narrow, obstinate Scotchman,
while the white is, of course, the brilliant, witty, condescending Mr.
Harris. This is the leitmotif of the whole book. The “Portraits” are used
to emphasize and accentuate the superior features of the “painter”; the
“sitters” are familiarly patted on the shoulder, pulled by a string like marionettes,
and made to talk “nice” by whim of the ventriloquist. Defenceless
dummies!
</p>

<p>
In one place Mr. Harris spontaneously exclaims—about the only time
he gives the impression of spontaneity: “What a pity St. Paul did not write
a ‘Life of Jesus!’” Frank Harris would. He would surely not miss the
opportunity of capitalizing such a “contemporary portrait.” What a pity
Mr. Harris has not met at a dinner given by Lady-and-So Mr. Socrates, or
Mr. Moses, or Mr. Adam! What a loss of a good seller.
</p>

<p>
An editor of a brave magazine, which allows its contributors the free
use of the first personal pronoun, has rebuked me for my too-subjective animosity
towards Mr. Harris’s book and for my failure to see its other, better,
side. I find my justification in Mr. Harris’s own words: “I put these portraits
forth as works of art.” In the same measure as the artist is allowed—or
rather, expected—to present that which seems to him most intrinsic and
striking in his subject, so am I, the appreciator, to have the liberty of criticising
in a work of art those features that appear to me most salient and
conspicuous. As a matter of fact I enjoyed reading Mr. Harris’s characteristics
of the persons he has met; he doubtless has an artistic touch in his
pen-and-ink portraits; his criticisms on Mathew Arnold, John Davidson,
Richard Middleton, are interesting. But it is the leitmotif of the book that
gives you a general impression. The impression it made on me I have told
in the preceding paragraphs. The pages on Whistler, Wilde, Verlaine,
Renan, and others, are malodorous; the persons whom you admire or love
appear blurred and maimed, for in front of them spins the annoying little
figure of the portraitist, who preaches good behavior to Oscar, who is charitable
<a id="page-44" class="pagenum" title="44"></a>
to Jimmy, who tells silly anecdotes about Paul, who condescendingly
smiles at old Renan, and journalistically interviews Anatole France and
Maeterlinck.

<em>The Poets’ Translation Series</em>
</h3>

<p class="first">
<span class="firstchar">T</span><span class="postfirstchar">he</span> object of the editors of this series is to present a number
of translations of Greek and Latin poetry and prose, especially
of those authors who are less frequently given in English.
</p>

<p>
This literature has too long been the property of pedagogues,
philologists and professors. Its human qualities have been obscured
by the wranglings of grammarians, who love it principally because
to them it is so safe and so dead.
</p>

<p>
But to many of us it is not dead. It is more alive, more essential,
more human than anything we can find in contemporary English
literature. The publication of such classics, in the way we propose,
may help to create a higher standard for poetry than that which
prevails, and a higher standard of appreciation of the writers of
antiquity, who have suffered too long at the hands of clumsy
metrists. We do not deny that there are many good translations in
English of classical writers—Lang’s <em>Homer</em> and <em>Theokritos</em>, Mackail’s
<em>Anthology</em> or Aldington’s <em>Apuleius</em>, for instance; but too often
such works are lonely and austerely expensive.
</p>

<p>
THE POET’S TRANSLATION SERIES will appear first
in <em>The Egoist</em> (starting September 1st) and will then be reprinted
and issued as small pamphlets, simple and inexpensive, so that none
will buy except to read. The translations will be done by poets
whose interest in their authors will be neither conventional nor
frigid. The translators will take no concern with glosses, notes,
or any of the apparatus with which learning smothers beauty. They
will endeavor to give the words of these Greek and Latin authors
as simply and as clearly as may be. Where the text is confused,
they will use the most characteristic version; where obscure, they
will interpret.
</p>

<p>
The first six pamphlets, when bound together, will form a small
collection of unhackneyed poetry, too long buried under the dust of
pedantic scholarship. They range over a period of two thousand
<a id="page-46" class="pagenum" title="46"></a>
years of literature—a proof of the amazing vitality of the Hellenic
tradition.
</p>

<p>
If this venture has the success its promoters look for, other
similar and possibly larger pamphlets will be issued.
</p>

<p>
1. (Ready September) The complete poems (25) of Anyte
of Tegea, now brought together in English for the first time: translated
by Richard Aldington. (8 pages) 2d. (2½d. post free).

<em>Richard Aldington, London</em>:
</p>

<p>
... It is almost impossible to get English people to subscribe to an American
literary review. English people are so conservative, so self-satisfied, that it will be
years and years and years and <em>years</em> before they even become aware of the new spirit
in America—and then it will be more years and years and years before they will take
it seriously and still more years before they will <em>pay</em> to know anything of it. In a
sense, you are more fortunate than we are—in England the big circulating libraries
have almost stopped the sale of new books, and there is such an amazing mental lassitude
that no one ever buys literary and art periodicals. England is well behind the
four other great powers—France, Russia, Austria, and Germany. There seems to be
a tremendous Renaissance in Russia, but that comes, I think, from their reading French
stuff seriously. Have you ever tried to make an English person—I expect it’s the
same with Americans—read a new French book, a book which has original ideas?
If you haven’t, don’t!
</p>

<p>
... Is Comstock’s successor worse or better? It seems to me—who am
down-trodden by a corrupt aristocracy—amazing that the Great Republic (?) should
humbly let Comstock sit on its head for forty years; why even in stodgy, money-bagged,
hypocritical old England, someone would have arisen—some Shaw—and assassinated
him! There is no tyranny for the artist comparable to that of an “enlightened” (God
save us) democracy. Notice that Vienna and Petrograd, the two capitals of benighted
feudalism, are, at this moment, the two great art centres of the world. Paris has
become a provincial town since the war; I don’t believe it will recover—at least not
for a decade.

“<em>Ursus</em>”:
</p>

<p>
How dare you seek the adventure of beauty? To release, to joy, to clout with
hilarious freedom is to outguess the crowd. To outguess the crowd is to encourage
critical suicide in episodal splendor. The unknowable is not wanted known; to venture
is contagion.
</p>

<p>
Man ruts—knowingly, wilfully; slithers in purring abandon so long as steaks fry
and pieces of silver rattle in the pocket. When you attempt to stir unthinking
recesses, whip at latent possibilities, you prove that you outclass, and he stares fishily
from his Mongolian eyes. You seek beauty; the average person tortures it! His
father did not diet him upon such. Your creed is not his. Mass brains chemicalize
into a common ingredient. Why precipitate? The world wants its filing cabinets
to contain regular, trimmed memos.
</p>

<p>
How dare you seek the adventure of beauty? Shall you consecrate yourself to
individual newness, to truth, against age-old creeds? Against mountains of odds?
</p>

<p>
Then I congratulate you. You are different—you shall be singular and never
plural. Go your way! You may find beauty because of the adventures in seeking it.

<em>Arthur Davison Ficke, Davenport, Iowa</em>:
</p>

<p>
Witter Bynner has sent me a copy of his letter to you on the subject of the imagists,
with the rubric—“Come at them yourself! Print something about them! The public
<a id="page-48" class="pagenum" title="48"></a>
mustn’t think itself alone in disliking them!” In spite of our very old friendship,—or
perhaps because of it,—he and I have never agreed on any subject under the sun;
and now, when I find that the greater part of his letter is just what I should like to
say, I am dissuaded from following his suggestion only by the fear that he and I must
both be wrong since we are at last in agreement. But I suppose that even an unholy
alliance cannot poison a good cause; and I therefore beg you to append this as a footnote
to Bynner’s communication.

<em>AN OBJECTION</em>
</h3>

<p class="from">
<em>John F. Weedon, Chicago</em>:
</p>

<p>
Your menu promises “Literature, Drama, Music, Art,” and as your guest I sat
down to enjoy one of those “feasts of reason and flows of soul,—so extremely rare
since <em>The Chap Book</em> went out of print,—and I was immediately plunged into five or
six pages of dyspeptic regurgitation of war dope.
</p>

<p>
I hate the war,—I am sick of the war. It is not, according to my well-worn lexicon,
either Literature, Drama, Music, or Art. I came near pitching your magazine
into the waste paper basket and getting a drink to take the taste out of my mouth.
</p>

<p>
Really, we caterpillars are tired of the war. Can we not find refuge from it even
in <span class="smallcaps">The Little Review</span>, or will you always get the head of Charles the First into your
Memorial?
</p>

<p>
However, I admit the picture of Rupert Brooke alone was worth the price of
admission; and Ben Hecht,—I don’t know who he is,—I could love like a brother.
Lucian Cary is enjoyable, and your stuff is good but a little inclined to be sophomorish.
I bet old Dr. Johnson would have insisted that “you define your terms, young man.”
</p>

<p>
Anyhow, as an elderly gentleman with a large family I bow to the superknowledge
and exuberance of your youth, and freely admit you are giving full value for the money.
But you will cut out the “vaarrr”—von’t you?
</p>

<p class="note">
<em>The following letter, typical of many that come in, expresses much of what we
have hoped to do through</em> <span class="smallcaps">The Little Review</span>.
</p>

<p class="noindent">
Until I read Mr. Ben Hecht’s article on <em>The American Family</em> in the August issue
I had not believed that any one in America would have the courage to give expression
to the terrible truth about our most prized institution, the family. It is splendid;
it is the kind of thing we “struggling daughters” need to keep us from being unselfish
once too often.
</p>

<p>
I imagine there are not enough emancipated souls in Chicago who are understanding
your work to make a word of sincere appreciation a mere bore.... My
social position is such that just a suggestion of the revolutionary things which are
“going on inside” would be a matter for intense horror to most of my friends. <span class="smallcaps">The
Little Review</span> is one of the sources from which I am deriving strength to cling to
my ideals, and to keep on hoping until school is finished and it is time to strike for
freedom.

<em>THE “ARTIST IN LIFE”</em>
</h3>

<p class="from">
<em>M. Isadore Lyon, Chicago</em>:
</p>

<p>
Please permit me to point out to all the Mrs. Quackenbushes in one that the
obviously clear though much misunderstood article, <em>The Artist in Life</em>, so far from
being a snobbish self-revelation of pessimism is a clarion feast of optimism; it is the
optimistic urge back of it which presupposes people <em>do</em> possess latent will power,
latent art love back of—deep under—the lethargic brooding sleep of the Mass. It is
a strong plea to cease crawling in slumpy illusions and become self-conscious, self-directed
beings. I would ask the Quackenbushes to read it from this view point.

POETRY publishes the best verse now being written in English, and its

</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
